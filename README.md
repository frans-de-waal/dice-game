1v1, rounds of highest **D12** rolls, first to 2 wins.

Each round:

- Each player rolls **D12** (*in private, shares with DM*)
- Each player chooses one of the following actions to take (*in private, shares with DM*):
  - **Keep** - the player **keeps** their current **D12** roll result.
  - **Fold** - when either of the players **folds** then the round is a **draw**. Neither of the **D12** results are revealed. Each player may only **Fold** once.
  - **Reroll** - the player makes a private **Slight of Hand** check (*shares with DM*) against the opponents **Passive Perception**.
    - If the player succeeds they can **reroll** their **D12**. They must **keep** the new result.
    - If the player fails their action is revealed to the opponent and they **lose** the round.
  - **Bluf** - the player tries to convince the opponent to **Fold** by making a **Deception**, **Persuasion** or **Intimidation** check against the opponent's **Insight** check.
    - If the player succeeds the opponent must **Fold** as described above (*i.e. the opponent **Folds** this round and cannot choose to **Fold** in future rounds since they now already folded once*).
    - If the player fails then nothing happens, the player **Keeps** as described above.
- Once both players' actions are resolved and both players end up **Keeping** then the results are revealed and the player with the highest result **wins**.
